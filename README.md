# Working Application

# Objective

User Story: I can see US Gross Domestic Product by quarter, over time.

User Story: I can mouse over a bar and see a tooltip with the GDP amount and exact year and month that bar represents.

# Challenges
My biggest challenge was understanding the differences in version 3 and 4 of the D3 library. In many cases I like to see some kind of working example because sometimes the documentation for programming libraries can be very difficult to understand.
Through online searches I was able to get a better understanding of the library differences. 
My second biggest challange was getting the scales to work the way I wanted to. I finally understood that through using a function within the parameters I could manipulate the data the way I wanted to.
